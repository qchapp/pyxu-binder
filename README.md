# 🧪 Pyxu Binder Notebooks

This repository provides interactive Jupyter Notebooks powered by **Binder**, showcasing example workflows using **[Pyxu](https://pyxu-org.github.io/)** — a modular and scalable Python package for computational imaging with CPU and GPU support.

> ⚠️ **Note:** All notebooks in this repository are directly taken from the official [Pyxu examples](https://github.com/pyxu-org/pyxu/tree/master/doc/examples).  
> This repo simply makes them easier to explore interactively using Binder — we do not claim authorship over their content.
