    "# Using Contributed Plugins in Pyxu\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore how to use contributed plugins in the Pyxu software framework. We will focus on the `pyxu-gradient-descent` plugin. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Attempting to Import Before Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before installing the plugin, let's try importing an object from the `pyxu-gradient-descent` namespace to see what happens.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    from pyxu.opt.solver import GradientDescent\n",
    "except ImportError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9; font-family: monospace;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "cannot import name 'GradientDescent' from 'pyxu.opt.solver' (pyxu/opt/solver/__init__.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see an *ImportError*, indicating that the objects are not available because the plugin is not installed yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Installing the Plugin\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the pyxu-gradient-descent plugin, use the following magic command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "!pip install pyxu-gradient-descent\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Importing the Necessary Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have installed the plugin, let's import the necessary objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pyxu.operator import SquaredL2Norm\n",
    "from pyxu.opt.solver import GradientDescent\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div style=\" padding: 10px; background-color: #ffe6e6;\">\n",
    "pyxu/info/plugin.py:69: ContributionWarning: Plugin `GradientDescent` loaded, use with caution.\n",
    "  warnings.warn(f\"Plugin `{name}` loaded, use with caution.\", pxw.ContributionWarning)\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The warning signals that a class or function has been imported from external code into the core Pyxu codebase, and should be used with caution. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Using the Gradient Descent Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, we will use the gradient descent algorithm to minimize a function defined by the squared L2 norm. Here is how you can do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define the dimension\n",
    "N = 100\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate random data\n",
    "rng = np.random.default_rng(seed=0)\n",
    "y = rng.uniform(size=N)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the loss function\n",
    "loss = SquaredL2Norm(dim_shape=(N, )).asloss(y)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the gradient descent algorithm\n",
    "gd = GradientDescent(f=loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the initial point\n",
    "x0 = np.random.randn(N)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the gradient descent algorithm\n",
    "gd.fit(x0=x0, acceleration=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check the solution\n",
    "assert np.allclose(gd.solution(), y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9; font-family: monospace;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "INFO -- [2023-09-13 09:28:52.933466] Iteration 0\n",
    "    \n",
    "\titeration: 0\n",
    "    RelError[x]: 0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "INFO -- [2023-09-13 09:28:52.934287] Iteration 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    iteration: 1\n",
    "    RelError[x]: 1.1798071385920126\n",
    "\n",
    "INFO -- [2023-09-13 09:28:52.934882] Iteration 2\n",
    "\n",
    "    iteration: 2\n",

    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything runs without errors, it means that the gradient descent algorithm has successfully found a solution that is close to the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have seen how to use contributed plugins in the Pyxu software framework. We learned how to install a plugin and use it to run a gradient descent algorithm. We hope this guide has been helpful, and encourage you to explore other plugins available for the Pyxu framework."
